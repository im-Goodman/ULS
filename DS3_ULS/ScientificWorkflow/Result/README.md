# Scientific Workflow

LIGO and Montage were constructed according to the structures of the corresponding scientific workflows.

A small-scale experiment was conducted here, comparing ULS with the main baseline, HEFT_RT. 

Two scientific workflows and radar correlation were selected here, and 500 workflows were randomly injected to obtain the results shown in the figures.

The conclusion is consistent with the paper.
