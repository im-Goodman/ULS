# Scientific Workflow
LIGO and Montage are constructed according to the structures of the corresponding scientific workflows.

A small-scale experiment is conducted here, comparing ULS with HEFT_RT, the main baseline. 

Two scientific workflows and Radar Correlation are selected here, and 500 workflows are randomly injected to obtain the results shown in the figures.

The conclusion is consistent with the paper, highlighting the superiority of ULS.
