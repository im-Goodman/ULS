# Scientific Workflow
We have adapted the LIGO and Montage scientific workflows from the Pegasus project to the DS3 simulator. 

500 instances of the two scientific workflows and the Radar Correlation workflow are randomly injected to the HCS platform. ULS and HEFT_RT are used as the scheduling algorithms, and the experimental results in terms of DMR and OT are shown in the figures.
