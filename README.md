# ULS
**Step1** Input the relavant parameters in "config_file.ini".

**Step2** Redirect the output paths in "processing_element.py", "job_generator.py", and "ULS.py".

**Step3** Run "DASH_Sim_v0".

The functions of "ULS_cpp/main.cpp" and "ULS.py" are implemented in the same way. The latter is proposed only for scalability evaluation.
